# Prediction-of-Natural-Disasters-using-ML-AI-etc.


Here we will use the knowledge of Machine Learning by first training the model using the various features like for example-In Earthquake, its main feature by which we can determine where and by how much intensity it will occur is seismic waves.It occurs due to sudden release of 
energy in the Earth's Lithosphere.So we will gather data of this energy from previous years and train our model and can use it to predict where the
next earthquake will occur.

AI based warning system can drastically improve the way we predict earthquakes. By installing sensors in buildings and nearby areas, we can detect P-waves and warn citizens in advance.AI based warning system is based on relevant data that is installed on the computers, which in turn provide theories and models. Here, information is installed about the quality of material used for home construction, when they were built and what are the possibilities of them collapsing once earthquake hits. We can also feed data about the surrounding environment that whether the area lies in seismic zone or not, about elevation, quality of soil and the amount of humidity.

Furthermore, we can update our system with relevant data about traffic in the quake-zone area, total number of ambulances, hospitals, fire departments etc. Eventually, the computer will give information about the danger zone in advance and the number of casualties we can expect in that area. Computers will also provide theories and models with the help of machine learning technology. It uses algorithm to define the pattern and possibility of earthquakes and regularly comes up with new models.Since, the communication system is completely disrupted during a disaster as a result, it becomes a challenging task to send help to the needy at right time. Here, AI based sensors can be used to help locate the victims.



The aim of one concernn is to aid emergency operation centers by providing resources required during rescue operations. They plan modules for training purposes by replicating lifelike disasters. This way they can train rescuers to perform well during operations. They are using tools based on Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to map the area, allowing people to remain alert and prepared in case of natural disasters.

During a disaster, ML and AI, when combined together, can help responders:
- track and predict disaster trajectory;

- identify location-based urgent needs and most impacted regions;

- gain predictive insight into what resources need to be allocated first and where; 

- gather and uncover trends in user-generated social-media reports of needs, impact, death tolls, and missing persons;

- send life-saving aid to most impacted or at risk regions;

- send targeted danger warnings to potential victims; 

- send location-based and timely safety information; and

- locate victims to coordinate their rescue.
