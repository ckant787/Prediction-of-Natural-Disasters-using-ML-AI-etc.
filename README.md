# Prediction-of-Natural-Disasters-using-ML-AI-etc.
Good predictions and warnings save lives. We will build a solution to help cities better predict and prepare for natural disasters.
Here we will use the knowledge of Machine Learning by first training the model using various features like for example-In Earthquake
its main feature by which we can determine where and by how much intensity it will occur is seismic waves.It occurs due to sudden release of 
energy in the Earth's Lithosphere.So we will data of this energy from previous years and train our model and can use it to predict where the
next earthquake will occur.

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help predict and respond to large-scale disasters like earthquake, flood and landslides. Together, they can turn into a life-saving tool during emergency and support disaster management efforts. Robots, sensors and drones based on AI and machine learning can become a relevant prototype providing accurate information during a catastrophe. In fact, several relief agencies and governments  can also use these smart analytics tools to deal with adverse situations and coordinate efficiently during disaster relief program.
